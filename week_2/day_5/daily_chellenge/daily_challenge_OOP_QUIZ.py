"""
1️ What is a class?
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods.

2️ What is an instance?
An instance is a specific object created from a class.

3️ What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object's components, protecting data integrity.

4️ What is abstraction?
Abstraction hides complex details and shows only essential features.

5️ What is inheritance?
Inheritance allows a class to derive attributes and methods from another class.

6️ What is multiple inheritance?
Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class.

7️ What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated the same way if they share method names.

8️ What is Method Resolution Order (MRO)?
MRO defines the order in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes.

        random.shuffle(self.cards)

        if len(self.cards) == 0:
            return "No cards left to deal!"
        return self.cards.pop()


# ✅ Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    deck = Deck()
    print(f"Total cards before shuffle: {len(deck.cards)}")
    deck.shuffle()
    print("Dealing one card:", deck.deal())
    print(f"Cards left in deck: {len(deck.cards)}")
